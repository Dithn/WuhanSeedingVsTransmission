# Scenarios and parameter sampling

* Stratify the analysis by seeding event size and duration:
  * Event size: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100
  * Event duration: 7 days, 14 days, 28 days
* Sampled parameters:
  * Serial interval: 8.4 (SD: 3.8) from Lispsitch et al. (2003)
  * K: 0.16 from Lloyd-Smith (2005)
* Fitted parameters
  * R0: Uniform(0, 5) prior
* Case bounds:
  * Lower bound: 780
  * Upper bound 880

# Scenario analysis

1. Branching process from `bpmodels`.
   * Assumes a negative binomial distribution on new cases
   * Assumes that the serial interval is gaussian distributed. 
2. Run an outbreak for each day of the assumed seeding event.
3. Summarise outbreaks across a single seeding event.



# Restrict scenarios and summarise output

* Restrict potential scenarios based on an upper and lower bound of total cases.

* Summarise each outbreak across samples.

* Report number of accepted samples per scenario.

* Condition on reported cases on the 3rd and the 20th of January
