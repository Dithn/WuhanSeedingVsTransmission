Introduction
------------

The ongoing pneumonia outbreak appears to have originated from an
animal-to-human transmission event at Huanan seafood wholesale market in
Wuhan, China which was closed on the 31st of December 2019 (1,2). As of
the 26th of January 2020 there are over 2000 confirmed case with the
majority in China (3). Globally, countries are on high alert with wide
implementation of airport checks and contact tracing. In China,
officials have restricted travel aross a wide area. There is still
uncertainty around the precise scale and duration of the initial
transmission (seeding) event. This has implications for the likely
transmissibility of the infectious agent responsible for the outbreak
and as such it is important that these potential scenarios are explored
and their likelihood quantified.

We used a stochastic branching process model - parameterised with
available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003
SARS outbreak - to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We considered a range of
parameters where data was not available, quantifying how likely these
scenarios were to occur using reported cases (with reporting
uncertainty). We focussed on the size and duration of the
animal-to-human crossover event in particular, and the impact this has
on the estimated level of human-to-human transmission. We aimed to
provide decision makers, and researchers, with probability estimates for
each scenario considered, along with estimates of the reproduction
number (including uncertainty) across all scenarios.

Methods
-------

**Branching process model**

We modelled the outbreak using a stochastic branching process. We
assumed that cases from the initial seeding event were uniformly
distributed over the duration of the seeding event. Each case then
resulted in a subsequent generation of cases with the number that each
case generated being drawn from a negative binomial distribution - to
account for overdisperion - with a dispersion of 0.16 (assuming SARs
like dispersion)(4). The mean number of cases generated by each case
(the reproduction number) was sampled from a uniform distribution once
per model simulation with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound
determined by the scenario being evaluated. Generations were then
sampled iteratively until the maximum simulation time was reached. The
serial interval between each generation was assumed to be normal with a
mean varied during the scenario analysis and a standard deviation of 3.8
(assuming a SARS like distribution)(4). After the simulation of the
branching process reporting delay was added to each case. The reporting
delay was sampled from either a normal, a poisson, or a negative
binomial distribution. This was determined by fitting these
distributions to the compiled linelist of cases in China (*reference
needed*) and selecting the best fit using the Chi-squared statistic. If
no good fit was determined - using an arbitary thresold of 0.05 - then
the reporting delay was instead sampled from the reported delays in the
linelist.

**Scenario analysis**

We simulated the branching process model 10,000 times for all
combinations of the following parameters: seeding event size (20, 40,
60, 80, 200), seeding event duration (7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28
days), the mean of the serial interval (4 days, 8.4 days(4), 12)), and
the upper bound of the reproduction number (1, 2, 3, 4). Parameter
values used in the scenario analysis were either assumptions based on
the current knowledge of the Wuhan outbreak or based on those used
previously for SARs(4). We ran the model from the beginning of the
outbreak for each scenario until the 25th of January 2020. The start
date was determined by combining the duration of the seeding event with
the date the fish market in Wuhan - the source of the outbreak - closed
(31st of December 2019). Outbreak simulation was stopped if a sample
exceeded 5000 cases by the end of simulation period.

**Conditioning on available case numbers**

We evaluated each scenario sample based on the cases observed on the 3rd
of January (41 observed cases with an assumed upper bound of 400 cases),
the 18th of Janurary (200 cases with an assumed upper bound of 2000
cases), and the 25th of January (1975 cases with an assumed upper bound
of 5000 cases). Samples were rejected if their simulated cumulative
cases were not consistent with these data. Uncertainty in the observed
number of cases was assumed to be 10 times the number of observed cases
for the 3rd and 18th of January and the number of observed plus the
number of potential cases reported on the 25th of January.

**Analysis**

We compared the percentage of samples that were accepted stratified by
the seeding event size and seeding event duration for every combination
of upper reproduction number bounds and mean serial intervals. We then
used heatmaps to identify which scenarios were more likely to represent
the underlying outbreak. We then reported the median, maximum, and
minimum reproduction numbers of samples accepted after conditioning on
the observed data, stratified by the seeding event size, seeding event
duration and the assumed mean serial interval.

**Implementatation**

All analysis was carried out using R version 3.6.2(5). The branching
process model was implemented using the `bpmodels` package(6). The
analysis is available as an open-source R package (*need reference -
zenodo doi*). A dockerfile has been made available with the code to
ensure reproducibility(7). All analysis was run on a 16 core 4Ghz
machine.
