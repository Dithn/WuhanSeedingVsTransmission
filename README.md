# Wuhan: Seeding vs transmission

**Aim:** Can we rule out transmission scenarios and give thresholds for other potential scenarios?

## Scenarios

1. Massive point source with very low human to human transmission (low R0).
2. Smaller point source with ongoing human -> human transmission (higher R0).

## Explore

* Look at transmission and point source scenarios to see what the probability is that R0 is greater than 1.
* Need multiple scenarios to check with generation time (could look at short and long (SARS ~ 8.7 days))
* Scenarios around how long the point source lasted (gene sequences indicate the 16th of December as the point estimate).

## Usage

* Use `analysis.Rmd` to run the analysis

### Set up

* Set your working directory to the home directory of this project (or use the provided Rstudio project).

* Run the following to check the installation of all required packages.

```r
devtools::install_deps()
```
