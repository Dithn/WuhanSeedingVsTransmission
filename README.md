# Evaluating transmission scenarios for the Wuhan outbreak

**Aim:** Can we rule out transmission scenarios and give thresholds for other potential scenarios?

## Scenarios
​
1. Massive point source with very low human to human transmission (low R0).
2. Smaller point source with ongoing human -> human transmission (higher R0).
​
## Explore
​
* Look at transmission and point source scenarios to see what the probability is that R0 is greater than 1.
* Need multiple scenarios to check with generation time (could look at short and long (SARS ~ 8.7 days))
* Scenarios around how long the point source lasted (gene sequences indicate the 16th of December as the point estimate).

## Analysis

### Data

* **Need** Daily cases

### Model

* Use branching process model from Joel's work

### Scenarios

* Look at plausible transmission, generation time, initial point source size and duration estimates
* The approach can either be probabilistic or scenario based (or a mixture of these).


## Usage

### Set up

* Set your working directory to the home directory of this project (or use the provided Rstudio project).

* Run the following to check the installation of all required packages.

### Folders

### Run an analysis
